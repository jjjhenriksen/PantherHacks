# Wellness Wizard

## About the Project
Wellness Wizard is our team's submission to the inaugural PantherHacks! We used [Chapman University brand colors](https://brand.chapman.edu/colors/) in honor of PantherHacks being the first Chapman hackathon! 

We built this web application using Bootstrap, Node.js, and the OpenAI API.

## Getting Started
### Libraries/Dependencies Used
**Icons:**
- https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
- https://fontawesome.com/icons

**APIs:**
- OpenAI API
- Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Node.js

### To execute the project locally:
If you don't have Node.js installed on your computer, install it first.
`brew install npm`

Then use these commands:
```npm install axios
npm install express
npm install cors```

After installing, use `node server.js` in your terminal and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Congratulations, you've summoned the Wellness Wizard! âœ¨
